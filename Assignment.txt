## Introduction ##
This is part 1 of the project assignment, which accounts for 50% of the grade for the course.
In groups, students will develop a Task Management API — a system for managing projects, tasks, and users.
The system will offer functionality for creating projects, adding tasks, setting status, and assigning tasks to users.
Think of it as a simple variant of Trello, Asana, or Todoist, but only as an API.

## Requirements Specification ##
1. Project Structure:
- Create a new .NET 8 Web API project.
- Create separate folders for Controllers, Models, Services, and Data.
- Model Classes with following Properties: 
   1. User: Id, Username, Password, Email.
   2. Project: Id, Name, Description, CreatedDate, UserId (project owner).
   3. TaskItem: Id, Title, Description, Status (e.g. "To Do", "In Progress", "Done"), DueDate, ProjectId, AssignedUserId (user responsible for the task). 
   4. Comment (optional, but recommended for those who want an extra challenge): Id, Text, CreatedDate,  TaskItemId, UserId. 
Feel free to add additional properties or relationships if it makes sense for the structure.

2. Database: 
- Use Entity Framework Core to set up an SQLite database.
- Create a DbContext class to handle database operations.
- Seed the database with some sample users, projects, and tasks. 

3. API Controllers: 
 - AuthController, handles user registration and login (returns JWT token). 
- ProjectController, handles CRUD operations for projects entities. Only owners should be able to modify or delete their own projects.
- TaskController: CRUD operations for tasks. Ability to update status and assign tasks to users. 
- CommentController (Optional) handles CRUD operations for comments on tasks.

4. Functionality: 
- Users should be able to register and log in (JWT authentication).
- Users should be able to: 
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete projects,
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks associated with their projects,
  - Change the status of tasks (To Do → In Progress → Done),
  - Assign tasks to themselves or other users.

5. Authentication and authorization via JWT token: 
   Users should only have access to their own projects and tasks.

6. Documentation. 
The group should submit a short document describing:
- What the task was about.
- How you have structured the project (Controllers, Services, Models, etc.).
- Brief explanation of Program.cs.
- Discussion of the work process – what worked, what was challenging, what you would do differently.

7. Extra functionality (optional): 
- Add a comment system to tasks.
- Add notifications (e.g. when a task has a changed status or a new responsible person).
- Option for file URLs linked to tasks.
- Sorting and filtering tasks by status, date or user.

## Assessment ##
Emphasis is placed on:
- Structure and architecture (Controllers, Services, Models, Data),
- Functional functionality and use of JWT,
- Quality of documentation and cleanliness of the code.
- Creativity and any additional functionality.

## Submission ##
Delivered as a zip file as contains: 
- Source code for the project.
- Video demonstrating API functionality in Swagger or Postman.
- PDF with documentation (as described above). 

## Continuation ##
In Part 2, students will individually develop a Blazor app that uses this API.
The Blazor app will consume the API endpoints and provide a user-friendly front end for project management.
The better the structure and document of the API now, the easier it will be to continue working in Part 2.
